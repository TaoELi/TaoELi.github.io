@article{Li2022RTNEO,
abstract = {Molecular polaritons have become an emerging platform for remotely
controlling molecular properties through strong light-matter interactions.
Herein, a semiclassical approach is developed for describing molecular
polaritons by self-consistently propagating the real-time dynamics of classical
cavity modes and a quantum molecular subsystem described by the
nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, where electrons and specified nuclei
are treated quantum mechanically on the same level. This semiclassical
real-time NEO approach provides a unified description of electronic and
vibrational strong couplings and describes the impact of the cavity on coupled
nuclear-electronic dynamics while including nuclear quantum effects. For a
single o-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecule under electronic strong coupling, this
approach shows that the cavity suppression of excited state intramolecular
proton transfer is influenced not only by the polaritonic potential energy
surface but also by the timescale of the chemical reaction. This work provides
the foundation for exploring collective strong coupling in nuclear-electronic
quantum dynamical systems within optical cavities.},

@article{Li2022TRPMD,
abstract = {A quantum simulation of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in the collective regime via thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) is reported. For a collection of liquid-phase water molecules resonantly coupled to a single lossless cavity mode, the simulation shows that, as compared with a fully classical calculation, the inclusion of nuclear and photonic quantum effects does not lead to a change in the Rabi splitting but does broaden polaritonic linewidths roughly by a factor of two. Moreover, under thermal equilibrium, both quantum and classical simulations predict that the static dielectric constant of liquid water is largely unchanged inside versus outside the cavity. This result disagrees with a recent experiment demonstrating that the static dielectric constant of liquid water can be resonantly enhanced under VSC, suggesting either limitations of our approach or perhaps other experimental factors that have not yet been explored.},

@article{Li2021Relaxation,
	abstract = {Under vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the formation of molecular polaritons may significantly modify the photo-induced or thermal properties of molecules. In an effort to understand these intriguing modifications, both experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the ultrafast dynamics of vibrational polaritons. Here, following our recent work [J. Chem. Phys., 154, 094124, (2021)], we systematically study the mechanism of polariton relaxation for liquid CO2 under a weak external pumping. Classical cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulations show that polariton relaxation results from the combined effects of (i) cavity loss through the photonic component and (ii) dephasing of the bright-mode component to vibrational dark modes as mediated by intermolecular interactions. The latter polaritonic dephasing rate is proportional to the product of the weight of the bright mode in the polariton wave function and the spectral overlap between the polariton and dark modes. Both these factors are sensitive to parameters such as the Rabi splitting and cavity mode detuning. Compared with a Fermi's golden rule calculation based on a tight-binding harmonic model, CavMD yields similar parameter dependence for the upper polariton relaxation lifetime but sometimes a modest disagreement for the lower polariton. We suggest that this disagreement results from polariton-enhanced molecular nonlinear absorption due to molecular anharmonicity, which is not included in our analytical model. We also summarize recent progress on probing nonreactive VSC dynamics with CavMD.},

@article{Li2021Solute,
	abstract = {Selectively exciting target molecules to high vibrational states is inefficient in the liquid phase, which restricts the use of IR pumping to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate that this inefficiency can be largely solved by confining the liquid in an optical cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions. For a liquid solution of 13CO2 solute in a 12CO2 solvent, cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that exciting a polariton (hybrid light-matter state) of the solvent with an intense laser pulse, under suitable resonant conditions, may lead to a very strong (> 3 quanta) and ultrafast (< 1 ps) excitation of the solute, all while the solvent is barely excited. By contrast, outside a cavity the same input pulse fluence can excite the solute by only half a vibrational quantum and the selectivity of excitation is low. Our finding is robust under different cavity volumes, which may lead to observable cavity enhancement on IR photochemical reactions in Fabry-Perot cavities.},
