	abstract = {Chemical manifestations of strong light–matter coupling have recently been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies. Here we review the present status of this field. Section 1 is an introduction to molecular polaritonics and to collective response aspects of light–matter interactions. Section 2 provides an overview of the key experimental observations of these effects, while Section 3 describes our current theoretical understanding of the effect of strong light–matter coupling on chemical dynamics. A brief outline of applications to energy conversion processes is given in Section 4. Pending technical issues in the construction of theoretical approaches are briefly described in Section 5. Finally, the summary in Section 6 outlines the paths ahead in this exciting endeavor.},

@article{Li2021Collective,
	abstract = {For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid-phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot-molecule relaxation. The physical mechanism underlying this acceleration is the fact that polaritons, especially the lower polariton, can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates (i) resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, (ii) cooperatively depend on molecular concentration or Rabi splitting, and (iii) collectively scale with the number of hot molecules, which is similar to Dicke's superradiance. For larger cavity volumes, due to a balance between this superradiant-like behavior and a smaller light-matter coupling, the total VSC effect on relaxation rates can scale slower than 1/N, and the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N $\sim 10^4$ molecules forming VSC. Moreover, we find that the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than equally distributing it to all thermal molecules. Finally, we highlight the similarities of parameter dependence between the current finding with VSC catalysis observed in Fabry-Perot microcavities.},

@article{Li2020Nonlinear,
	abstract = {Recent experiments have observed that the chemical and photophysical properties of molecules can be modified inside an optical Fabry-Perot mirocavity under collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) conditions, and such modification is currently not well understood by theory. In an effort to understand the origin of such cavity induced phenomena, some recent studies have focused on the effect of the cavity environment on the nonlinear optical response of the molecular subsystem. Here, we use a recently proposed protocol for classical cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulations to numerically investigate the linear and nonlinear response of liquid carbon dioxide under such VSC conditions following an optical pulse excitation. We find that applying a strong pulse of excitation to the lower hybrid light-matter state, i.e., the lower polariton (LP), can lead to molecular nonlinear absorption which is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the excitation outside the cavity. The underlying mechanism is polariton-enhanced multiphoton absorption which leads to an ultrashort LP lifetime (0.2 ps) under strong illumination. Because the mechanism of the observed phenomenon is generic in nature, we expect these numerical predictions to be experimentally observed in different molecular systems.},

@article{Li2020Origin,
	abstract = {Recent experiments suggest that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) may significantly modify ground-state chemical reactions and their rates even without external pumping. The intrinsic mechanism of this "vacuum-field catalysis" remains largely unclear. Generally, modifications of thermal reactions in the ground electronic states are caused by equilibrium or non-equilibrium effects. The former are associated with modifications of the reactant equilibrium distribution as expressed by the transition state theory of chemical reaction rates, while the latter stem from the dynamics of reaching and leaving transition configurations. Here, within a classical model, we examine the VSC effect in a cavity environment on chemical rates as calculated by transition state theory. Our approach is to examine the effect of coupling to cavity mode(s) on the potential of mean force (PMF) associated with the reaction coordinate. We find that, while the PMF can be affected by the cavity environment, this effect is negligible for the usual cavities used to examine VSC situations. We conclude that observations of "vacuum-field catalysis" associated with VSC must reflect non-equilibrium aspects of the observed chemical rates.},

@article{Li2020MMSTCav,
	abstract = {We model a collection of N two-level systems (TLSs) coupled to a multimode cavity via Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) dynamics, sampling both electronic and photonic zero-point energies (ZPEs) and propagating independent trajectories in Wigner phase space. By investigating the ground state stability of a single TLS, we use MMST dynamics to separately study both electronic ZPE effects (which would naively lead to the breakdown of the electronic ground state) as well as photonic ZPE effects (which would naively lead to spontaneous absorption). By contrast, including both effects (i.e., sampling both electronic and photonic ZPEs) leads to the dynamical stability of the electronic ground state. Therefore, MMST dynamics provide a practical way to identify the contributions of self-interaction and vacuum fluctuations. More importantly, we find that MMST dynamics can predict accurate quantum dynamics for both electronic populations and EM field intensity. For a single TLS in a cavity, MMST dynamics correctly predict the initial exponential decay of spontaneous emission, Poincar\'e recurrences, and the positional dependence of a spontaneous emission rate. For an array of N equally spaced TLSs with only one TLS excited initially, MMST dynamics correctly predict the modification of spontaneous emission rate as a function of the spacing between TLSs. Finally, MMST dynamics also correctly model Dicke's superradiance and subradiance (i.e., the dynamics when all TLSs are excited initially) including the correct quantum statistics for the delay time (as found by counting trajectories, for which a full quantum simulation is hard to achieve). Therefore, this work raises the possibility of simulating large-scale collective light-matter interactions with methods beyond mean-field theory.},

@article{Li2019Hamiltonians,
	abstract = {Semiclassical electrodynamics is an appealing approach for studying light-matter interactions, especially for realistic molecular systems. However, there is no unique semiclassical scheme. On the one hand, intermolecular interactions can be described instantaneously by static two-body interactions connecting different molecules plus a classical transverse E-field; we will call this Hamiltonian {\#}I. On the other hand, intermolecular interactions can also be described as effects that are mediated exclusively through a classical one-body E-field without any quantum effects at all (assuming we ignore electronic exchange); we will call this Hamiltonian {\#}II. Moreover, one can also mix these two Hamiltonians into a third, hybrid Hamiltonian, which preserves quantum electron-electron correlations for lower excitations but describes higher excitations in a mean-field way. To investigate which semiclassical scheme is most reliable for practical use, here we study the real-time dynamics of a pair of identical two-level systems (TLSs) undergoing either resonance energy transfer (RET) or collectively driven dynamics. While all approaches perform reasonably well when there is no strong external excitation, we find that no single approach is perfect for all conditions. Each method has its own distinct problems: Hamiltonian {\#}I performs best for RET but behaves in a complicated manner for driven dynamics. Hamiltonian {\#}II is always stable, but obviously fails for RET at short distances. One key finding is that, under externally driving, a full configuration interaction description of Hamiltonian {\#}I strongly overestimates the long-time electronic energy, highlighting the not obvious fact that, if one plans to merge quantum molecules with classical light, a full, exact treatment of electron-electron correlations can actually lead to worse results than a simple mean-field treatment.},

For a two-level system coupled to classical radiation fields, three semiclassical methods are benchmarked: (1) Ehrenfest dynamics overestimate the excited-state population at equilibrium due to the failure of capturing vacuum fluctuations. (2) The coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations, which supplement Ehrenfest dynamics by damping at the full golden rule rate, underestimate the excited state population due to double-counting of the self-interaction effect. (3) Ehrenfest + R dynamics recover detailed balance and the correct thermal equilibrium by enforcing the correct balance between the optical excitation and spontaneous emission of the quantum system.

In fact, by not relying on the rotating wave approximation, a semiclassical model predicts some quantum effects beyond the quantum optical Bloch equation, including higher order scattering and asymmetric sideband features. This letter highlights the fact that, with strong intensities, many putatively quantum features of light-matter interactions arise from a simple balance of mean-field electrodynamics and elementary spontaneous emission which requires minimal computational cost.

@article{Li2019Comparison,
	abstract = {The optical response of an electronic two-level system (TLS) coupled to an incident continuous wave (cw) electromagnetic (EM) field is simulated explicitly in one dimension by the following five approaches: (i) the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations, (ii) the optical Bloch equation (OBE), (iii) Ehrenfest dynamics, (iv) the Ehrenfest+R approach and (v) classical dielectric theory (CDT). Our findings are as follows: (i) standard Ehrenfest dynamics predict the correct optical signals only in the linear response regime where vacuum fluctuations are not important; (ii) both the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations and CDT predict incorrect features for the optical signals in the linear response regime due to a double-counting of self-interaction; (iii) by exactly balancing the effects of self-interaction versus the effects of quantum fluctuations (and insisting on energy conservation), the Ehrenfest+R approach generates the correct optical signals in the linear regime and slightly beyond, yielding, e.g., the correct ratio between the coherent and incoherent scattering EM fields. As such, Ehrenfest+R dynamics agree with dynamics from the quantum OBE, but whereas the latter is easily applicable only for a single TLS in vacuum, the former should be applicable to large systems in environments with arbitrary dielectrics. Thus, this benchmark study suggests that the Ehrenfest+R approach may be very advantageous for simulating light-matter interactions semiclassically.},

On the other hand, if we invoke a classical intermolecular Coulomb operator, we find that the energy transfer in the near field loses quantitative accuracy compared with F$\backslash$"orster theory, even though causality is strictly obeyed.

@article{Li2018Spontaneous,
	abstract = {The dynamics of an electronic two-level system coupled to an electromagnetic field are simulated explicitly for one and three dimensional systems through semiclassical propagation of the Maxwell-Liouville equations. We consider three flavors of mixed quantum-classical dynamics: the classical path approximation (CPA), Ehrenfest dynamics, and symmetrical quantum-classical (SQC) dynamics. The CPA fails to recover a consistent description of spontaneous emission. A consistent "spontaneous" emission can be obtained from Ehrenfest dynamics--provided that one starts in an electronic superposition state. Spontaneous emission is always obtained using SQC dynamics. Using the SQC and Ehrenfest frameworks, we further calculate the dynamics following an incoming pulse, but here we find very different responses: SQC and Ehrenfest dynamics deviate sometimes strongly in the calculated rate of decay of the transient excited state. Nevertheless, our work confirms the earlier observations by W. Miller [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 2188-2195, 1978] that Ehrenfest dynamics can effectively describe some aspects of spontaneous emission and highlights new possibilities for studying light-matter interactions with semiclassical mechanics.},
