With the increasing number of research papers each year, it is becoming more challenging to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in our fields of interest. Here's an app that can provide you with **weekly preprint recommendations** based on your research record. Additionally, with the assistance of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), this app can summarize each recommended preprint with two sentences, as we call the **AIstract**. The following is an example email from PaperRadar:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/paperradar.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
