I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University working with Professor [Sharon Hammes-Schiffer](https://www.hammes-schiffer-group.org/). My research focuses on understanding and modeling the **interactions between light and matter**, as well as **quantum molecular dynamics**. I am also interested in various technological developments in quantum computing and artificial intelligence. One of my significant research contributions is the development of the [cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD)](https://taoeli.github.io/cavmd/) approach for simulating vibrational polaritons.

In addition to research, I have created a simple app called [PaperRadar.com](PaperRadar.com). This service can send you weekly preprint recommendations based on your research record. If you are interested, please click [here](https://taoeli.github.io/paperradar/) to give it a try.

Please feel free to contact me through email:

tao.li@yale.edu or taoli@sas.upenn.edu.
